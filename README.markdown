# Flickr TwitPic

Small [Sinatra][] application that lists photos from flickr (you need to provide your
api key), and lets you twit this photos on twitter (you need to provide your twitter
login and password) using twitpic.

## Why?

Because I'll use it this weekend (27/12/2008 - 30/12/2008) to follow 
[https://events.ccc.de/congress/2008/][25c3] conference, and it could serve to
follow other events too.

## How to use

Just clone the repo, and add a `config/config.yml` (see `config/config.sample.yml` for an
extremely easy example). Then run `ruby flickr-twit.rb`, and you're done! For an easy 
way to deploy Sinatra apps to production, [cschneid][] has a great blog post about [setting 
up thin with Sinatra][thin-setup].

## Example

Check out [http://twitter.com/26c3_medias][example] for a running example of this app.

## Warning

This is mostly a proof-of-concept, which just happens to work perfectly fine for me. 
If your photos are not publicly accesible, or you don't allow anonymous users to download 
the "Original" sized pics from your account, then this might not work.

But hey, it's open source ;)
